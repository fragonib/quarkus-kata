= Technical aspects

== Technologies used

* Gradle (for building project)
* Kotlin (for production code)
* Hexagonal architecture
* Reactive modules

== Focused on

* Design patterns
* SOLID
* Event oriented design

== Requirements

. To have at least JVM 11 to build and run the project
. GraalVM to build native app

== Running

To build the entire app with:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

To build the entire app but without running any tests:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew clean build -x test
----

To run all tests, external dependencies (ie: DB engines) are mocked:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew test
----

To run the entire app (in localhost) in PROD mode:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

[NOTE]
====
Requires a running mongo database cluster. You can play with local one:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -ti --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo
----
====

Once up &amp; running you can check and interact with the REST API using http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui[swagger UI]


To run application in DEV mode:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusDev
----

In this mode you can interact with app http://localhost:8080/q/dev[dev insights]
